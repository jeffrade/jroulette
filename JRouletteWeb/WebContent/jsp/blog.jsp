	<h4 align="left">A Look at the Martingale Strategy</h4>
	<p align="left">
		Even money bets have inspired many players over the years to 
		attempt to beat the game by using strategies like the Martingale betting strategy.
		where a player at least doubles the bet after every loss, so that the first win would recover 
		all previous losses, plus win a profit. The problem with this 
		strategy is that, remembering that past results do not affect the future, it is possible
		for the player to lose so many times in a row, that the player, doubling and redoubling 
		his bets, either runs out of money or their bet becomes to high since the table will have a max bet.
	</p>
	<p align="left">
		Martingale strategies came about during the 18th century in France.
		The simplest strategy was designed where a player wins his stake if 
		a coin comes up heads, and loses if tails. The strategy had the gambler double
		his bet after every loss, so that the first win would recover all previous losses plus win a 
		profit. Now a player with infinite wealth will, almost surely, 
		eventually flip heads, so the Martingale strategy was seen as full-proof. Of course, nobody has 
		infinite wealth, so the increase in bets would eventually bankrupt the player.

		So bottom line?  Use, but be preparred to lose all your money quickly.  If you win early, 
		don't be greedy, just take your winnings and go to dinner.

	<h4 align="left">Biased Wheels Payed Big</h4>
	<p align="left">
		In the early 90s, Gonzalo Garcia-Pelayo thought that roulette wheels were not perfectly random (meaning imperfections in the wheel 			itslef).  He though by recording the results and analysing them with a computer, he could gain an edge on the house
		by predicting that certain numbers were more likely to occur next than the 1-in-36 odds offered by the 
		house suggested. He did this at the Casino de Madrid in Madrid, Spain, winning 600,000 euros in a single 
		day, and one million euros overall. The casino too legal action, but was unsuccessful, the court ruled that the casino 
		should simply fix their wheels.
	</p>
	<p align="left">
		Today, casinos monitor the performance of their wheels, rebalance and 
		realign them to try and keep the result perfectly random (every number having an equal percentage of possibly coming up).
	</p>
	<p align="left">
		A new wheel, designed by George Melas, was called "low-profile" because the number pockets reduced in depth, and various other design 			modifications caused the ball to descend in a gradual approach to a number. In 1986, the professional gambling team headed by 
		Billy Walters won 3.8 million dollars using this analysis system on an old wheel that was in place at the Golden Nugget in Atlantic 			City.  Virtually every casino in the world took note, and in 12 months they switched to the new low-profile roulette wheel.
	</p>
	<p align="left">
		There are online websites that clame their analysis programs can sniff out a biased wheel (online casinos are linked to live wheels) and 			will allow you to take the house.  We have not tried these out, but would be interested in hearing from you if you have.
